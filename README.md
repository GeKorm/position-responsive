# position-responsive
Position-aware responsive web design

Web designers have a plethora of tools to control how their applications look in multiple sizes.
But what about in multiple *positions*?

This library aims to provide these tools.
For now it deals with position-aware positioning, more specifically: viewport, window and screen-relative.

A CSS polyfill is planned but the spec is still undetermined.
